System
======
* OSX
  -> Client is a Mac outfit, so *might* "lock-in" to this.
* Linux
  -> less "lock-in"  :)
  * Ubuntu 10.04 (Long Term Service)
    -> Chris uses day-to-day
  * CentOS
    -> Dougal uses this on some production server?
  

Language
========
* ruby
  -> of course!  :)


Framework
=========
* rails
  * rails3
    -> gotta move forward, not back
* sinatra
  -> too light for this app


Datastore
=========
* Mongo/Couch
  -> no replication needed so don't see the point of using them.
    (plan to run on a single server in the Melbourne office)
* RDBMS
  * mysql
    -> probably use this
 

ORM
===
* ActiveRecord
  -> if we run into problems using DataMapper
* Datamapper
  -> because its ready


Template Engine
===============
* haml
  -> developer friendly
* erb
  -> designer friendly;
     so probably use haml, just in case a designer has to look at it.


Thumbnail Creation
==================
* ImageScience ( http://seattlerb.rubyforge.org/ImageScience.html )
  -> only seems to work for images (ie. not documents, spreadsheets etc) 
* ImageMagick/RMagick
  -> stick with the magick


Search Platform
===============
* Solr ( http://lucene.apache.org/solr/ )
  -> looks good


Misc
====
* LDAP
* Paperclip
* Formtastic
* ...
