Document storage mechanism.

To store assets via web interface.
The librarian will store the images, extract meta data and *attempt* to create a thumbnail of the document. 

Assets can be a variety of formats
* Images eg: jpeg, png or gif
* "Documents" eg: pdf, word, excel
* _Possible support for iWork docs_
* Other formats such as InDesign, which we don't expect to create thumbnails
